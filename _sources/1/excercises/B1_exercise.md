# Example of excercise written in markdown

## Work with the bash shell

### Select and concatenate data files

In Bash, `*` is a wildcard, which matches zero or more characters. When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a list of matching filenames before running the command that was asked for. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command as it is. For example typing `ls *.pdf` in the `mountain_data/` directory (which does not contains any pdf files) results in an error message that there is no file called `*.pdf`. 

Here's how the wildcard works in practice: `*.txt` matches annapurna-np.txt, chooyu-np.txt and every file that ends with ‘.txt’. On the other hand, `n*.txt` only matches nangaparbat-pl.txt because the ‘n’ at the front only matches filenames that begin with the letter ‘n’.

```{admonition} Exercise: Explore data files
 Take a look at the contents of the `mountain_data/` directory. Use `ls` and `cat` to inspect the names, file extensions and contents of the files. What patterns and information do you see? **Tip:** you can write your observations in comments section of the workshop website, and see what others observed. :)

The names of all the text files in the `mountain_data/` directory follow a standard pattern, `mountainname-countrycode.txt`. This is good practice when working with Bash - it is much easier to ask the computer to find and do something with files that match a convention in their names. You'll also see that there are no spaces in any filenames, and no capital letters. Instead, we see a lot of dashes.

We have three types of data files in the `mountain_data/` directory: .txt, .jpg, and .md. The only .md file is called README.md, and contains some very brief information about the data and the imaginary project they were collected for. It is good practice as well to include a README.md file with any code or data project, and to fill it with documentation that can help you or someone else replicate the data and/or the results of your research.

```{admonition} Exercise: Select and concatenate data files
 Right now, the data for each mountain in the `mountain_data/` folder are each stored in separate files per mountain. That might be helpful for some applications, but we want a list of data in one .txt file called tallest-mountains.txt. How could we do that? **Hint:** We did this during the teaching session for all mountains in Nepal. The command to use starts with an 'a' and reminds me of my teenage years... :)

We can use the wildcard `*` to grab all the .txt files this time in the `mountain_data` folder. We want to concatenate the contents of every txt file in the folder, so we should use `*.txt` to match all the files in the directory. To concatenate, we use the `awk` command (used for pattern scanning and processing) along with the 1 flag which automatically inserts a new line between the data from each of the separate files. The `>` symbol will concatenate the contents of all files that match this naming pattern to a new file that we define, in this case called tallest-mountains.txt.

`$ awk 1 *.txt > tallest-mountains.txt`

You can use `ls` to see the files in the `mountain_data/` folder, and `cat` to check out the contents of the newly created `tallest-mountains.txt`.

```{admonition} Exercise: add data to tallest-mountains.txt
 Right now, the tallest-mountains.txt file contains geographic and population data for the 10 tallest mountains in the world. A good start, but there are many more cool mountains in the world! Add a few more mountains to the tallest-mountains.txt file using nano on the command line. Don't forget to keep the same format as the rest of the data: name, lat, lon, height in meters, successful ascents(pre-2004), unsuccessful ascents(pre-2004). **Hint:** You can find a link to the data source in the `mountain_data/README.md` file. 
```

Use nano to open the tallest-mountains.txt file to add some data for other mountains in the world. Make sure you start a new line for each mountain you add.

`cd mountain_data`
`$ nano tallest-mountains.txt`

Hit shift + control + O to "WriteOut" the file (save it). Nano will ask you if you want to save this file with the same name, and we do, so hit enter. You can then hit shift + control + X to exit the Nano text editor and get back to your Bash shell.

You can do the same process to edit the README.md file: `nano README.md` will open the editor and allow you to insert information about the sources of your data.

If you now use cat to check out the contents of your file(s), you should see the changes you've made:

`$ cat tallest-mountains.txt` ; `cat README.md`
